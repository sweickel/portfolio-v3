        I'm a self-taught Software Engineer with a passion for front-end web development. I thrive on learning new technologies and adapting to different challenges, always striving to improve my skills and deliver high-quality solutions. My experience spans working with frameworks like Angular and React, as well as building APIs using C#, Node.js, and NestJS.
        <br /><br />
        I enjoy working with both SQL and NoSQL databases, and have hands-on experience with CMS platforms such as Sitecore and WordPress. Beyond front-end development, I'm interested in DevOps practices, including CI/CD pipelines with tools like Terraform and CircleCI. I'm also enthusiastic about integrating AI into development workflows to create smarter, more efficient applications.
